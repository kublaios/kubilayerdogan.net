I met a computer for the first time for about 20+ years ago. We have good communication since then.  

My interest in computers has navigated me to get my bachelor’s degree in computer science. I’ve been working as a programmer/developer ever since I graduated in 2010.

Recently, web development and mobile development excite me mostly. That’s because the way of using technology is becoming more transportable. Web browsers and mobile devices are making this happen.

Therefore, I intend to share my experiences with these platforms on this website. This share might be with sample codes or articles, news, maybe even projects and tutorials. If you have an interest in any of these, keep following here, and don’t forget to follow me on social media.

Ah, personally, I like to read books and watch movies, sometimes I make papercrafts and puzzles. And I like designing new things, whether they’re on a computer or in real life.

That’s all I got to tell so far. If you need to contact me, you can use my Twitter(@kublaios), Gmail(kublaios@gmail.com), or my other mail(kubilay@kubilayerdogan.net). I’ll return you as quickly as possible.

Stay tuned
Kubilay
