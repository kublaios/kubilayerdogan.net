A while ago, some guys hacked my web server and erased all my data. It wasn't a big concern for me since most of the things I was keeping there were outdated and the server was mostly for my pet projects. However, I took this as an opportunity to recreate my website using Jekyll. Well, this is the repository of that Jekyll project.
